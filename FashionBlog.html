            <img src="FashionBlog/Gabi-Gregg-–-OG-Fat-Girl.jpg.avif" alt="">
    <p>Gabi Gregg set off on this journey to tackle the infuriating gap for plus size women. 
        She started off her plus-size fashion blog about a decade ago to pave a path in a way
        that promotes body positivity while being impeccably stylish, vibrant, and colorful. 
        Her outfits are full of life just like her, and so is her clothing line Premme, which 
        caters to plus sizes. She brought, what she calls ‘the fatkini’, by collaborating with 
        ‘Playful Promises’ and ‘Swimsuits’, and showed us how it’s done. We need more women 
        like her, and thanks to social media, we get to follow her around.</p>

    <p>The 5-foot-something petite blogger inspires you in more ways than one. A fashion-forward 
        blogger with a passion for people, art, culture, and music brings all of it together. Wendy 
        wears a lot of hats; she is a blogger, content creator, and a juvenile justice advocate who 
        is just as passionately working towards helping foster children, because she understands the 
        struggle, for she has been one. From moving foster homes to graduating from UCLA, Berkeley 
        in Psychology, to being an influencer, she is indeed an inspiration. She believes that you 
        can rope it all together and make fashion statements that replicate it all. Check her blog for 
        some much-needed inspiration.</p>

         the needs of women over 50s, 60s, and beyond. You won’t find too many people like her, but 
         you know the world needs more of that. With snow-white coiffed hair, this sixty-something grandmother 
         is living it all up and raising bars, more like breaking barriers for all the right reasons. With floral
          kimonos, flaming hot oversized sunglasses, and a contagious fashion sense, Lyn Slater believes 
          and shows us time and again that ‘age is just a variable.’ Thanks for proving the world wrong, Lyn, your 
          757K and growing fan club couldn’t be more grateful.</p>

         and everything else caught the attention of big brands in no time. She had a 
         substantial social media presence even before she turned into a fashion blogger.
          Tami wanted to do something concrete, and that’s how it all started. From being a red-carpet
           consultant to an entrepreneur, Tami Reed is a go-getter! For more inspiration and to stay updated

        confused as any 16-year-old would be. However, she kept at it and discovered her love for fashion and travel 
        with every passing year. And today she has 58k (and growing) Instagram followers. Just with perseverance, a
         lot of hard work, and a little luck, she grew in the industry. She is associated with big brands and is a

        insecurities and looking a certain way seem to be our lives’ biggest struggles. Her story from wanting
         to fit in to pursuing her passion for fashion doesn’t have to be typecasted after all. From owning up her 
         body type to spreading body positivity, and mostly being fashionable, Tanesha is a real star, the kind we 
         all need, the one in the most real sense. Follow her for tips, hacks, trends, and everything in lifestyle,

        <h2>10. Claire Goldsworthy – The Fashion Advocate</h2>
            <img src="FashionBlog/Claire-Goldsworthy-–-The-Fashion-Advocate.jpg.avif" alt="">
    <p>Claire Goldsworthy goes by and is famous for her Instagram handle – The Fashion Advocate and she is a real
         manifestation of that. The Australian fashion blogger is not your typical run-off-the-mill pulling off the 
         latest-trends-blogger. Rather, her style diary, which is her blog, got her thinking about the fast-moving
          fashion around us, and how we have forgotten the art of consuming products with values and ethics. She 
          interviews, associates, and encourages brands with an ethical and moral binding as opposed to just the 
          highs of fast fashion that become obsolete almost instantly. Check her blog, and follow her on Insta, 
          and I’m sure she will get you thinking.</p>
